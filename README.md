# HR-DASHBOARD

 Excited to share my latest project! 

I recently developed an HR dashboard using Power BI that provides a holistic view of workforce dynamics within an organization. This comprehensive dashboard encompasses six key performance indicators (KPIs):

Headcount
Total Salary
Active Employees
Terminated Employees
Male Employees
Female Employees
To enhance data exploration and interactivity, I incorporated two slicers for Department and Year, allowing users to filter and analyze data based on specific criteria.

Here's a breakdown of the visualizations included in the dashboard:

Pie Charts: Insights into Employee Marital Status, Employee Satisfaction, and Employee Performance.
Stacked Bar Charts: Detailed views of Recruitment Source and Employees by Department.
Map: Visualizes headcount by state, helping to identify geographical trends.
Multi-row Card: Displays salary distribution by department, offering a clear breakdown of salary allocations.


I would love to hear your feedback and any suggestions you might have!
